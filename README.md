This repository hosts a project focused on training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the ImageDataGenerator class,
from TensorFlow on the Horses or Humans dataset.
The dataset, encompassing over a thousand images of horses and humans, spans various poses and file sizes.
Through this project, a CNN model is built and trained on the dataset, 
with images resized to 300x300 and incorporating convolution and max pooling layers to enhance feature extraction.
While the model demonstrates strong performance on individual horse or human images, 
it exhibits a slight decrease in accuracy when presented with images combining both humans and horses.
